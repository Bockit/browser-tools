Browser Tools
-------------

I'd finally had enough of including jQuery for only a few specific use-cases. What I wanted was an incredibly modular library for things you do in the browser.

Browser tools is designed with browserify in mind, where it will only build the file with the functionality you're using.

Browser tools aims to provide the following functionality, at a very granular level:

* AJAX Requests
* CSS Getting and Settings
* Element dimension calculations
* Element position calculations
* DOM Traversal
